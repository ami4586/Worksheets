5. Arrange the following in decreasing order of the precedence when they appear in an expression in python?

9. Which of the following statements are correct?
Ans : A) Division and multiplication have same precedence in python,
         D) In case of operators’ having same precedence, the one on the left side is executed first.

10. Which of the following is(are) valid statement(s) in python?
Ans : A) abc = 1,000,000
         C) a,b,c = 1000, 2000, 3000
         D) a_b_c = 1,000,000

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Ans : 
         List -> is a simple collection of objects. It is ordered (we can tell which elements come before or after which other element).
         A list can contain objects of different types, including other lists.
         A list can contain duplicates, i.e., two or more objects having same value and even two objects with same id, can coexist in a list

        Set -> is also a collection of objects but it is unordered and doesn't allow duplicates.
        Tuple -> A tuple is like a list with one difference that tuples are immutable.
Immutability allows them to be used in places where lists can't be (keys of dictionaries).

        Dictionary -> Known in other languages as hash tables, associative arrays, maps, etc.
        They are like lists but instead of integers you can use any immutable type as the index (including strings).

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python.
Ans : In python, the string data types are immutable. Which means a string value cannot be updated.

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.
Ans : The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
          Example:
                         x = ord("h")
                           Return the integer that represents the character "h"

          Function for getting the datatype is type(<VARIABLE_NAME>).
                         a=12
                        print(type(a))
