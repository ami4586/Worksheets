12) R2 shows how well terms (data points) fit a curve or line. Adjusted R2 also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. If you add more and more useless variables to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease.

13) A cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y. This is typically expressed as a difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value. 

14) SST is the maximum sum of squares of errors for the data because the minimum information of Y itself was only used for the baseline model. ... The difference between SST and SSR is remaining unexplained variability of Y after adopting the regression model, which is called as sum of squares of errors (SSE).

15) The various metrics used to evaluate the results of the prediction are : Mean Squared Error(MSE) Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE). Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE).
