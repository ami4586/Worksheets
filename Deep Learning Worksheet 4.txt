11) Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
 Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
12) Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment
 in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
13) Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned.
 Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.
14) In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. 
15) Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”. 
   Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.
